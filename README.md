# Sovix-Linux
Hi, Its me RealEnderman. I am here to make Sovix Linux is because of the Chromebook audio issue. 
I am gonna explain,
Chromebook uses a STRICT audio driver and if using windows, it cost dollar for audio driver based on What Chromebook you have
It only supports max98357a, So it only supports intel Skylake (Intel apollolake might work) Its based on arch.
